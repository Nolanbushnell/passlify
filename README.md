# Passlify

Passlify is a password validation and generation library for JavaScript and TypeScript environments. It provides robust tools for implementing and enforcing password policies in web applications, with optional React integration.

## Core Functionality

- Configurable password validation rules
- Strength assessment using zxcvbn
- Entropy calculation
- Secure password generation
- Internationalization support
- TypeScript compatibility

## Installation

```bash
npm install passlify
```

## Usage

### Standard Implementation

```javascript
import Passlify from 'passlify';

const options = {
  min_characters: 12,
  max_characters: 64,
  special_chars: true,
  min_special_chars: 1,
  alpha: true,
  numeric: true,
  min_alpha: 1,
  min_numeric: 1,
  uppercase: true,
  lowercase: true,
  min_uppercase: 1,
  min_lowercase: 1,
  blacklist: ['password123', 'qwerty123'],
};

const passlify = new Passlify(options);

const result = passlify.check('P@ssw0rd123!');
console.log(result);
```

### React Integration

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { PasswordStrengthChecker } from 'passlify';

function PasswordField() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Password Validation</h2>
      <PasswordStrengthChecker />
    </div>
  );
}
```

## API Documentation

Refer to [API.md](docs/API.md) for comprehensive documentation on available methods and configuration options.

## Security Considerations

- Passlify is a tool to assist in implementing password policies. It does not guarantee the security of your application.
- Always use HTTPS for password transmission and follow best practices for password storage (e.g., using bcrypt or Argon2).
- Regularly update the package to ensure you have the latest security patches.
